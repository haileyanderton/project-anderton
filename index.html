  <h3>Radio</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most telling piece of data from the WMC 2015 report was the inclusion of Talker magazine’s <a href="http://www.talkers.com/2015-talkers-sports-heavy-hundred-%E2%80%A2-1-25/" target="_blank">“Heavy Hundred”</a>, a compilation of the 100 most important talk radio hosts in America. In 2015, the list included 88 men and only 12 women. It is also important to note that Talker only mentioned one female host on their 2015 "Sports Heavy Hundred", a list of the best Sports Radio hosts.</p>

<p>The radio industry as a whole is also lacking in equal representation for women. In 2015, females were 45.5% percent of the workforce in radio, up from 34.2% in 2013. However, only 23.1% of all news directors were female, down from 28.7% in 2013 and 18.1% of all radio general managers were female, a small increase from the 17.8% in 2013.</p>

      <h3>TV</h3>
      <p> Women in TV news are underrepresented in many areas.  Women participated significantly less as foreign policy analysts and reporters, making up only 22% in 2014. Women were 30.8% of all TV news directors in 2014, up from 28.7 percent in 2013 and a record high.</p>

      <p>According to media studies conducted from 2011-2013 by Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA, there is a major gender disparity in those holding television executive positions. In fact, 71% of Chairs/CEOs, 73% of senior management and 55% of unit heads were men.</p>

<p>The Bunche Center also reported that women were outnumbered...<p>

<ul>
  <li>almost 2 to 1 among cable TV show leads.</li>
  <li>2 to 1 among network TV reality show and other leads.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>2 to 1 among film leads.</li>
    <li>8 to 1 among film directors.</li>
    <li>about 4 to 1 among film writers.</li>

  <h3>Gaming</h3>
  <p>According to the Entertainment Software Association’s annual survey, 48% of gamers were female. Despite the significant amount of female gamers, there is a vast amount of underrepresentation in the Game Developer field. The International Game Developers Association conducted a 2014 Developer Satisfaction Survey that collected responses from 2,202, 76% of them were male.</p>


<div id="stuff"><p>67% of survey respondents said that sexism in the actual games influence society’s negative perceptions of the game industry, 51% said it was sexism in the game developer workforce. However, 79% of respondents reported that they believed diversity is important for the industry.</p></div>
