  <p>Women “[o]n nearly every front,”
Bunche Center researchers wrote,
were under-represented and outnumbered
by men:
2 to 1 among film leads.
8 to 1 among film directors.
About 4 to 1 among !lm writers</p>

<p>Ninety-three percent of those top grossing 250 movies had no female directors in 2014,
when 7 percent of all directors were female, a figure that was 1 percentage point higher
than in 2013 and 2 percentage points lower than in 1998.
The center found that 96 percent of the !lms had no female cinematographers, a
group accounting for 5 percent of all cinematographers hired on 2014’s !lm crews.
That was a 2 percentage point increase since 2013 and 1 percentage point higher
than the 1998 rate.
Seventy-nine percent of the !lms had no female writers; 78 percent had no female editors;
56 percent of them had no female executive producers; and 38 percent had no
female producers.</p>

  <p>Q Overall, 48 percent of
gamers were female.
Q Women and men each
purchased 50 percent of
video games.
Q Women aged 18 and
older were 36 percent of
gamers, while boys aged
18 and younger were 17
percent of gamers.
Q On average, all adult
gamers have been playing
for 16 years; women
have been playing for 13
years, on average, and
men for an average of 18
years.</p>

<p>67 percent of survey respondents said that sexism in the
games themselves, and 51 percent said sexism in the game developer workforce, were
among factors fueling negative public perceptions of the industry. Also, 79 percent of
respondents reported that they believed diversity is important for the industry. </p>

<p>Of young women aged 18-24, 26 percent said they had been stalked online and 25
percent said they were sexually harassed online, and that some of those threats were
sustained over an extended period.
 In addition, women said “they do not escape the heightened rates of physical threats
and sustained harassment common to their male peers and young people in general.”
Women were more likely than men to !nd their most recent experience with online
harassment extremely or very upsetting; 38 percent of those women and 17 percent
of those men described their suffering in those terms.</p>
