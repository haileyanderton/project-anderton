Week 1

This week I gathered the data that I will be using for my project. I am using the information gathered from this 2015 report. http://wmc.3cdn.net/83bf6082a319460eb1_hsrm680x2.pdf

I then formatted the basic html markup wrapping everything in divs with separate id and class names in order to make the css and js process easier.

Next, I researched the best way to make divs appear over an image, and found that the best way would be to format an image in photoshop, set it's position to absolute on my page, and make sure the content that will overlap with it has a higher z-index. I got some of these ideas from https://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/ after typing into google. It took a long time to get the css and positioning perfect on this and I found myself thinking that I was probably going about this in a less-than-efficient manor. In hindsight, I should've researched some sort of plug in or something that allows me to make an actual image responsive to clicks. It's not really how I wanted it to look.

I am frustrated because I am not sure how to get the visible divs on the woman's body to eventually respond to a click/hover without looking weird. I attempted to section the image off in photoshop, but I originally wanted to figure out a way to make the actual div fit the border of the image. I don't know if this is something I can fix. I might end up creating a button on each of the sections, instead of making the whole div respond to hovering/clicking.

Lastly, I looked back at some of my old work to see if I could figure out a way to create a popup div that appears when you click on a visible div. I successfully executed a hide/show function, looking back at my music-sampler assignment, but I am still working on a way to make a fadeIn effect apply to the correct specific divs on click. I want my page to look more modern and three-dimensional than it's currently looking, so that will definitely be a challenge. Also, I have to make sure it is responsive and include media queries. I am no where near finished, but I'm on my way!
